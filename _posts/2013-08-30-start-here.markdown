I'm a keyboard kind of guy. I look to use shortcuts whenever I can, and I will admit I get annoyed when I have to do something using the mouse.

### Good keyboard UX
I don't want this to be an entirely negative post, so I'll kick it off with some praise for what I think is an excellent user experience for keyboard enthusiasts.

Gmail really leads the way here. I really love being able to rip through my email without having to leave the keyboard. Not sure on a shortcut? No worries, just hit '?' and a list of commands shows up. Great! Don't want to use the keyboard? No worries! I'll bet that many userds don't even know the shortcuts exist, and they probably don't care either. But for those of us who want to go down that path, we're well taken care of.

### Lacking keyboard UX
Now the real reason for this post: Autofocus; or a lack thereof.

Why do some sites make it so hard to do things using just the keyboard? And worse still, why do some sites make it so hard for me to give you my money? Ok, well perhaps not so hard, but harder than it needs to be. I read an [article on Hacker News][1] a while back about the Javascript involved in keeping hover menus activated whilst navigating to submenus. It was obvious there was a good deal of effort spent not only designing and implementing that feature, but also analysing. I can understand why: lots of people use it. And while it might seem trivial from 10000 ft, it is enough to annoy at least some users. 

But then lots of people use search functionality, and I sometimes feel that not enough goes into making it as easy to use.

Lets use Amazon as the example again. If I go to Amazon I generally know what product I'm there for, and find it easier to search for rather than traverse the menu. With that said, I find myself having to click the search box before I can actually kick my search off. Why doesn't the searchbox have focus? I can think of a few possibilities:
1. Time on homepage. Amazon gets a good chance to show you a lot of ads when you first hit their page, and if you start searching right away, they've wasted a lot of potential views.
2. Navigation. Spacebar, pageup and pagedown will no longer navigate through the page. I think this is the biggest issue and quite reasonable. So then hitting tab should go to the search box right? Well.... that gets pretty tough. How is your browser configured? Are you a Safari style user where tabs navigate inputs only? Or do your tab presses go through every item on the page? I really dislike when certain expectations are overridden by the page I'm on, so I think that this is probably a bad option.

Maybe us keyboard warriors are destined to our browser search engine features. I use Chrome day to day, so I utilize a heap of these shortcuts to search engines. For details on how they are used see here for [Chrome][2] and [Firefox][3]. I actually have a search for Amazon setup using the keyword AMZ.

##### Disclaimer
I'm not a UX guy, and really this is just my pet peeve. These companies have more data points than what I could ever provide, so there is probably a good reason as to why things are done the way they are. If you know more, I'd love to hear about it.
